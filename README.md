## How to run
User can either compile assembly code into a hex file that can be read by the moncky-2 processor, or run a java-based simulation of the processor.

#### compiler
- place "code.txt" in "moncky2in" folder with assembly source code
- run "Moncky2Compiler.java"
- a new file will be created in "moncky2out" directory under the name "compiledCode.hex"

#### simulation/interpreter
- place "code.txt" in "moncky2in" folder with assembly source code
- run "Moncky2Interpreter.java"
- a new console window will appear and print all final values in the registers and memory
